Optional Specs, for future releases:

The program changes text-entry boxes to static text when Return is pressed.

When the user hovers over an item, an arrow appears. When clicked on, the arrow opens up a pane with more information about the to-do item.

When the user clicks the Done checkbox, a strikethrough appears through the item.

When the user hits Backspace on an empty item, the previous item is selected.
